# ipaddress-go

The [**Go**](https://golang.org/) IPAddress library

To put the source in $GOPATH/src:

go get github.com/seancfoley/ipaddress-go/ipaddr

The API is similar to the Java implementation, the primary differences being the nuances of the go language in comparison to Java, such as the lack of inheritance, differences with the permission modifiers (capitalization vs public/protected/private), more specific primitive types (eg uint64), returning errors instead of throwing exceptions, and others.
