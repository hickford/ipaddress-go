# ipaddress-go

The [**Go**](https://golang.org/) IPAddress library

go get github.com/seancfoley/ipaddress-go/ipaddr

The IPAddress library is also [available for Java](https://github.com/seancfoley/IPAddress).  The API is similar to the Java implementation, the primary differences being the nuances of the go language in comparison to Java.
